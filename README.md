# skin-lesion-classification

NOTE: This project was made during my Data Science studies, before i started using github, and thus the project setup structure are quite wonky.

Dataset available on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedxc4/skin-ds)



The project consist of three parts
- A shallow learner classifier
- A CNN classifier
- A CNN with pretrained weights from ImageNet.

First part is in the shallow-learners script, and the two later parts are in the deep-learning script.
